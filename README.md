# Pathfinding-Visualizer
**Pathfinding-Visualizer** is a simple program that visualizes common pathfinding algorithms.
You can place the start and target nodes, draw barrier nodes, and then run one of the implemented pathfinding algorithms.

## How to run
Everything is contained in the file `visualizer.py`, simply run the file to run the visualizer/program.
1. place nodes with left click
2. delete nodes with right click
3. to switch between what nodes you place, press the keys:
  - S: for start/source node
  - T: for target node
  - B: for barrier node
4. to run the pathfinding algorithms, press the keys:
  - 1: for depth first search
  - 2: for breadth first search
  - *3: Dijkstra's  pathfinding (not implemented yet)*
  - *4: A\* pathfinding (not implemented yet)*
